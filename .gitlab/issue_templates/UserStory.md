### Summary

<!--
A user story is a behaviour or feature that a solution needs to implement in order to fulfil the needs of a user.
* [customer]: For whom do we develop? We are not happy with a job title, we try to find the type of the character of the customer.
* [request]: What purpose does the customer actually want to achieve? This is how we describe the intention - not the functions that the customer uses. 
* [purpose]: How does the customer's immediate desire to be able to do something fit into his overall picture? What overall benefit does he want to gain? What major issue needs to be solved here?
