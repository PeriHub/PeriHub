abstract = {This paper introduces new features for PeriLab, a modern Peridynamics (PD) solver developed in the Julia programming language. Emphasizing ease of installation, usability, and extensibility, the code’s structure is presented alongside illustrative examples that demonstrate key functionalities. The main additions in version v1.3.6 are the introduction of a static solver and the coupling between Finite Element Method (FEM) and PD. These features are described in detail within the paper, enabling researchers to address fundamental questions in the field of PD. The static solver is based on Anderson acceleration and does not require gradient information.

abstract = {Abstract The study presents a framework for analyzing Additive Manufacturing processes within the Peridynamics (PD) software PeriLab. This framewor k employs a mesh-free, point-based numerical approach to approximate the continuum PD equations. Implemented within this framework are thermal, thermo-mechanical, and simple additive models. These models have been validated against analytical solutions, Finite Element (FE) models, and Peridigm simulations. To leverage the PD mesh-free implementation, the study introduces a novel boundary detection algorithm. This algorithm is essential because the outer surface area may change during the manufacturing process. It operates without requiring surface or topology information, relying instead on the comparison of neighborhood volume to sphere volume. Additionally, the study introduces a wrapper that generates the mesh necessary for simulating the printing process, based on the G-code machine input path. Finally, the study presents a comprehensive analysis of an L-shaped profile utilizing the developed features, comparing the results with those obtained from an Abaqus solution.},

abstract = {Abstract Over the past two decades, Peridynamics (PD) research has exhibited remarkable diversity, with contributions spanning more than 180 journals and involving over 1000 researchers. Despite its broad applicability, a persistent challenge remains—how to foster widespread adoption. In the engineering domain, classical continuum mechanics, predominantly facilitated by the finite element method, enjoys extensive utilization, supported by a plethora of commercial and open-source software tools. PD simulation tools often find themselves competing with these well-established counterparts. In research, custom codes tailored for specific applications are frequently created and applied, with little consideration for their future reuse or third-party utilization. The complexity is further exacerbated in High-performance computing (HPC) applications, where a deep understanding of solvers, parallel computing, and PD is imperative for a successful software development. Given the constraints of a typical doctoral thesis, large-scale problems are often left unexplored, and research tends to be confined to simplistic geometries. This paper aims to elucidate various pathways for the seamless integration and utilization of a PD framework. We will showcase examples that illustrate how the barriers for both users and developers can be significantly lowered, ultimately propelling PD simulation tools to a higher standard of maturity in the medium term.},

abstract = {Abstract The simulation of crack patterns, crack velocities, and dissipated energies is a challenging task. Peridynamics (PD) has been proven to be a powerful tool addressing all these problems, including crack propagation, crack branching, its velocity and delamination, and so forth. It is a nonlocal theory, where material points interact with other points (these interactions are called bonds) within a continuous neighborhood in a specific range, called horizon. Typically, for complex problems PD is solved numerically. Its implementations require a high spatial resolution for adequate representation of the damaged material behavior, which is related to the high computational costs. Additionally, because of the nonlocal nature of PD there are difficulties in applying the classical local initial and boundary conditions. This leads to the idea of coupling relatively expensive PD with a finite element method to reduce the computational efforts and also try to solve the boundary condition problem. If the whole domain can be divided into two subdomains, the area where the fracture is expected should be modeled with the PD and the rest with finite elements. The present work proposes a comparison of three coupling strategies in terms of damage-free dynamic problems with high-frequency excitement. Additionally the investigation of the influence of wave propagation on the fracture process, as well as on crack patterns is presented.},

abstract = {Abstract The peridynamic approach (PD) is a continuous theory that is well suited for solving damage problems. Because of the nonlocal formulation, PD can predict the response of a material and fracture patterns with high probability in high dynamic processes. In PD, some parameters differ from the continuum formulation and have some deviation in discretized PD systems, such as a horizon. A material constant becomes a parameter dependent on the mesh size. A sticking point, which has to be considered, is that an incomplete horizon at the boundaries results in an unphysical variation of the material's stiffness in these regions. Material points at the boundaries do not have an entire nonlocal neighborhood, meaning the points have fewer bonds and are softer than points within the domain. This leads to the so-called surface effect. The difficulties in applying the classical local initial and boundary conditions happen because of the nonlocal character of the PD. To overcome this problem, several correction techniques have been developed. Nevertheless, a standard method to describe them is not available yet. An alternative approach is the application of the earlier proposed FEM-PD coupling, which can be seen as a local-nonlocal coupling method. The damage-free zones are analyzed by the FEM as classical local theory, while the domain where the fracture is expected is modeled with the PD as a nonlocal theory. Consequently, the reduction of the computational effort as well as the imposing of the conventional local boundary conditions, is achieved. The coupling method is based on the Arlequin method—an energy-based procedure where the energy of a system is found as a weighted average of both systems. The mechanical compatibility in the overlapping zone of both domains is reached by implementing constraints with the help of the penalty method. In the paper at hand, the focus is on imposing BCs. The proposed method is applied to both static and dynamic applications. The accuracy and convergence behavior is evaluated by analyzing test examples.},

abstract = {Abstract A classical continuum mechanics model no longer fulfills its basic assumptions, when the deformations are not smooth or discontinuous. Peridynamics (PD) as an integral formulation could better overcome these issues. Therefore, it is better suited to solve fracture problems such as crack initiation, its growth and formation of crack patterns. In PD the magnitudes of internal forces at a material point depend on the collective interaction of all material points within a subdomain called horizon. To take advances from the formulation, typically it is implemented in a mesh-free form. In that case, it is easy to separate interactions between different material points. As consequence, a relatively high resolution is required to describe continuous deformation functions and, consequently computationally expensive. Therefore, the application of mesh-free PD in undamaged regions requires an unnecessary high effort for receiving sufficient accurate results. In contrast, the finite element method (FEM) as a classical continuum mechanics-based approach, is very efficient, if continuous stress distributions can be assumed. Consequently, a computational cost reduction can be achieved, if the PD is applied in the local damaged zone only and the remaining area is modeled and analyzed with the classical FEM. Realization of such an approach requires a sufficient accurate coupling of the PD and the FEM subdomains. A brief overview about different coupling approaches is given. Then the general approach of an Arlequin based method is presented. Here the coupling is achieved via an overlapping of PD and FEM areas. The coupling equations are developed and realized with help of the Penalty method. The Penalty method is considered as an alternative procedure to the Lagrange multiplier strategy without creating new unknowns, which essentially simplifies the coupled PD-FEM approach. The validity and limits of the proposed technique are demonstrated through analysis, where the choice of the Penalty number is discussed as well as artificial wave oscillations, caused by the coupling area.},
