      <div class="row">
        <p>
          <b> Information about Data Protection</b> <br />
          DLR takes the protection of personal data very seriously. We want you to know when we store data, which types
          of data are stored and how it is used. As an incorporated entity under German civil law, we are subject to the
          provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the
          Telecommunications Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDPA). This Data Protection Declaration explains which data
          we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the
          information is collected. We have taken technical and organisational measures to ensure our compliance and the
          compliance of external service providers with the data protection regulation.
          This website uses SSL – that is, TLS encryption – in order to protect the transfer of personal data and other
          confidential information (for example, orders or enquiries sent to the controller). A connection is encrypted
          if you see the character sequence 'https://' and the padlock icon in your browser's address bar.
          We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications)
          may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party
          access.<br><br />

          <b> I. Name and address of the controller</b> <br />

          <b> III. Definition of terms </b> <br />
          Among others, we use the following terms in this Privacy Policy, set out in the General Data Protection
          Regulation and the Federal Data Protection Act: <br> <br />
          1. Personal data <br> <br />
          Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter:
          ‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified – directly or indirectly – in
          particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
          identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
          cultural or social identity of that natural person. <br> <br />
          2. Data subject <br> <br />
          A data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the
          controller.
          3. Processing <br> <br />
          Processing is any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or on sets of personal data –
          whether or not by automated means – such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
          adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
          making available, alignment or combination, restriction, deletion or destruction. <br> <br />
          4. Restriction of processing <br> <br />
          Restriction of processing means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting its processing in
          the future. <br> <br />
          5. Profiling <br> <br />
          Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to
          evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
          concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
          interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. <br> <br />
          6. Pseudonymisation <br> <br />
          Pseudonymisation means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer
          be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such
          additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure
          that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. <br> <br />
          7. Controller or data processing controller <br> <br />
          Controller or data processing controller means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other
          body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal
          data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the
          controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law. <br>
          <br />
          8. Processor <br> <br />
          Processor means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that processes personal data
          on behalf of the controller.
          9. Recipient <br> <br />
          Recipient means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal
          data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities that may receive personal data
          in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
          recipients. <br> <br />
          10. Third party <br> <br />
          Third party means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject,
          controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are
          authorised to process personal data. <br> <br />
          11.Consent <br> <br />
          Consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data
          subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to
          the processing of personal data relating to him or her.<br> <br />

          <b>IV. General information on data processing </b> <br />
          1. Scope of processing of personal data<br> <br />
          We process personal data concerning our users exclusively to the extent required to provide a functioning
          website, as well as our content and services. Ordinarily, we will only process the personal data of our users
          after obtaining their consent. An exception to this rule is where obtaining prior consent is factually
          impossible and the processing of the data is permitted by law.<br> <br />
          2. Legal grounds for the processing of personal data<br> <br />
          Where we obtain consent from the data subject for the processing of personal data, the legal grounds are set
          out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br> <br />
          Where personal data is processed for the performance of a contract in which the data subject is a contractual
          partner, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (b) of the GDPR. This also applies to
          processing that is necessary for pre-contractual measures.<br> <br />
          Where personal data is processed for compliance with a legal obligation to which our research centre is
          subject, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (c) of the GDPR.<br> <br />
          Where processing of personal data is necessary for the protection of vital interests of the data subject or
          another natural person, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (d) of the GDPR.<br> <br />
          Where processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of our research centre or a third party, and where
          the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the first interests, the legal grounds
          are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (f) of the GDPR.<br> <br />
          3. Data deletion and duration of data storage<br> <br />
          The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer
          applies. In addition, storage takes place if authorised by Union or Member State directives, laws or other
          regulations to which the controller is subject. Blocking or deletion of the data shall also take place when a
          storage period stipulated by one of the above standards comes to an end, except where it is necessary to
          continue storing the data to enter into or perform a contract.<br> <br />
          4. Revocation of your consent to data processing<br> <br />
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have
          already given at any time with effect for the future. The legality of the data processing carried out until
          the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.<br> <br />

          <b>V. Processing operations</b> <br> <br />
          1. Server log files<br> <br />

          The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server
          log files, which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:<br> <br />
          • The type and version of browser used<br>
          • The used operating system<br>
          • Referrer URL<br>
          • The hostname of the accessing computer<br>
          • The time of the server inquiry<br>
          • The IP address <br> <br />

          This data is not merged with other data sources. <br> <br />

          This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest
          in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to achieve
          this, server log files must be recorded.<br> <br />
          The collection of data for the provision of our website and the storage of data in log files is crucial to
          operation of the website. Hence, users are not granted a right to object. <br> <br />

          2. Contact <br> <br />

          Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax<br>
          If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
          request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these
          data on without your consent.<br> <br />

          These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a
          contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are
          processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art.
          6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent can be
          revoked at any time.<br> <br />

          The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your
          consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request).
          Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.<br> <br />

          <!-- VI. Use of Cookies
            Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.

            In some cases, it is possible that third-party cookies are stored on your device once you enter our site (thirdparty cookies). These cookies enable you or us to take advantage of certain services offered by the third party (e.g., cookies for the processing of payment services).

            Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions would not work in the absence of the cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). The purpose of other cookies may be the analysis of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.

            Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions, or for the provision of certain functions you want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the optimization (required cookies) of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the technically error free and optimized provision of the operator’s services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, processing occurs exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TTDSG); this consent may be revoked at any time.

            You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.

            In the event that third-party cookies are used or if cookies are used for analytical purposes, we will
            separately notify you in conjunction with this Data Protection Policy and, if applicable, ask for your consent.

          <b>VI. Rights of the data subject </b> <br />
          Where personal data concerning you is processed, you are the data subject as defined in the EU General Data
          Protection Regulation (GDPR) and you have the following rights with respect to the controller:<br> <br />
          a) Right to information <br> <br />
          You have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation of whether personal data concerning you is
          processed by us. <br> <br />
          Where such processing takes place, you have the right to obtain the following information from the controller:
          <br> <br />
          • the purposes for which the personal data is processed; <br>
          • the categories of personal data that is processed; <br>
          • the recipients, or categories of recipients to whom the personal data relating to you has been or will be
          disclosed; <br>
          • the planned duration of storage of the personal data concerning you, or the criteria applied to defining the
          duration of storage if precise information in this regard is not available; <br>
          • the existence of a right to correction or deletion of the personal data concerning you, the right to
          restrict processing by the controller or the right to object to this processing; <br>
          • the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; <br>
          • all information available concerning the origins of the data if the personal data was not collected from the
          data subject;<br>
          • the existence of an automated decision-making process, including profiling, according to Art. 22 paragraphs
          1 and 4 of the GDPR and – at least in these cases – meaningful information on the logic and implications
          involved, as well as on the intended effects of this kind of processing on the data subject;<br>
          • You also have the right to obtain information on whether the personal data concerning you has or will be
          transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. In this regard, you are entitled to
          request information on the appropriate guarantees in place with regard to this processing in accordance with
          Art. 46 of the GDPR.<br> <br />
          The controller will provide a copy of the personal data that is subject to processing. Where you request
          additional copies, the controller is entitled to charge an appropriate fee based on administrative costs. If
          you place the application by electronic means, the information will be made available in a standard electronic
          format, except where otherwise specified by you. The right to receive a copy in accordance with paragraph 3 of
          this section must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.<br> <br />
          b) Right to correction <br> <br />
          As a data subject, you have the right to request from the controller the correction of inaccurate personal
          data concerning you without undue delay. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the
          right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary
          statement.<br> <br />
          c) Right to limit processing <br> <br />
          You have the right to request from the controller restriction of processing of personal data concerning you
          under the following conditions:<br> <br />
          • where the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, for a period enabling the controller to verify
          the accuracy of the personal data;<br>
          • the processing is unlawful and you oppose the deletion of the personal data, and instead request the
          restriction of its use;<br>
          • the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by
          you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;<br> or
          • if you have objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, pending the verification
          of whether the legitimate reasons of the controller override your reasons.<br> <br />
          Where processing of the personal data concerning you has been restricted, such personal data shall, with the
          exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of
          legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
          important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.<br> <br />
          Where you have obtained restriction of processing under the conditions set out above, you will be informed by
          the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted.<br> <br />
          d) Right to deletion<br> <br />
          Obligation to delete<br> <br />
          You have the right to request the controller to delete personal data concerning you without undue delay, and
          the controller will be obliged to delete personal data immediately where one of the following grounds
          applies:<br> <br />
          • the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise
          processed;<br>
          • you withdraw consent on which the processing is based according to part (a) of Art. 6, paragraph 1, or part
          (a) of Art. 9, paragraph 2 of the GDPR, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;<br>
          • you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21, paragraph 1 of the GDPR and there are no overriding
          legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21, paragraph 2 of the
          GDPR;<br>
          the personal data concerning you has been unlawfully processed;
          • the personal data has to be deleted to comply with a legal obligation under a Union or Member State law to
          which the controller is subject; <br>
          • The personal data concerning you has been collected in relation to the offer of information society services
          referred to in Art. 8, paragraph 1 of the GDPR. <br>
          • Information to third parties <br> <br />
          Information to third parties <br> <br />
          Where the controller has made the personal data concerning you public and is obliged pursuant to Art. 17,
          paragraph 1 of the GDPR to delete the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology
          and the cost of implementation, is required to take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform
          controllers who are processing the personal data that you have requested to be deleted by such controllers, as
          well as any links to, copies or replications of such personal data.<br> <br />
          Exceptions<br> <br />
          The right to deletion does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary: <br>
          • for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; <br>
          • for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or
          for the performance of tasks carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
          vested in the controller; <br>
          • for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with parts (h) and (i) of Art. 9,
          paragraph 2 and Art. 9, paragraph 3 of the GDPR; <br>
          • for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for
          statistical purposes in accordance with Art. 89, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, insofar as the rights referred to in
          section (a) are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that
          processing; or <br>
          • for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. <br> <br />
          e) Right to notification <br> <br />
          Where you have exercised the right to correction, deletion or restriction of processing with the data
          controller, the data controller shall be obliged to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning
          you was disclosed of this correction or deletion of data or of the restriction of processing, except where
          compliance proves to be impossible or is associated with a disproportionate effort. <br> <br />
          In addition, you are entitled to require that the data controller inform you about these recipients. <br>
          <br />
          f) Right to data portability <br> <br />
          You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to the controller, in
          a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transfer that data to another
          controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where: <br>
          <br />
          the processing is based on consent pursuant to part (a) of Article 6, paragraph 1 or part (a) of Article 9,
          paragraph 2 of the GDPR or in a contract pursuant to part (b) of Art. 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR; and<br>
          the processing is carried out by automated means.<br>
          In exercising your right to data portability, you have the right to have the personal data concerning you
          transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. This must not adversely
          affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.<br> <br />
          The right to data portability does not apply to processing that is necessary for the performance of a task
          carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.<br>
          <br />
          g) Right to object<br> <br />
          You have the right to object, at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing
          of personal data concerning you, which is based on parts (e) or (f) of Art. 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR; this
          includes profiling based on those provisions.<br> <br />
          The controller shall no longer process the personal data concerning you, unless the controller demonstrates
          compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the
          establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.<br> <br />
          Where personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object,
          at any time, to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing. This applies
          also to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.<br> <br />
          Where you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data will no longer be processed
          for such purposes.<br> <br />
          In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding directive 2002/58/EC, you may
          exercise your right to object by automated means that use technical specifications.<br> <br />
          Where personal data is processed for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes
          pursuant to Art. 89, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, you have the right, on grounds relating to your particular
          situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning you, except where the processing is necessary
          for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.<br> <br />
          Should you wish to exercise your right to withdraw consent or to object, please send an email to <a
            href="datenschutz@dlr.de">datenschutz@dlr.de</a><br><br />.
          h) Right to withdraw consent pursuant to Art. 7, paragraph 3 of the GDPR<br> <br />
          You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of data at any time, with future effect. In the
          event that you withdraw consent, we will delete the data concerned immediately, except where processing can be
          based on legal grounds that do not require consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness
          of processing carried out prior to withdrawal of consent.<br> <br />
          i) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling<br> <br />
          You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling,
          which produces legal effects for you or similarly significantly affects you.<br> <br />
          This does not apply if the decision:<br> <br />
          • is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and the data controller; <br>
          • is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also contains
          suitable measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms and legitimate interests; or <br>
          • is based on your explicit consent. <br>
          However, these decisions must not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Art 9,
          paragraph 1 of the GDPR, unless parts (a) or (g) of Art. 9, paragraph 2 of the GDPR applies and suitable
          measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.<br> <br />
          In the cases referred to in parts (1) and (3), the data controller is required to implement suitable measures
          to safeguard your rights, freedoms and legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain human
          intervention on the part of the controller, to express your own point of view and to contest the decision.<br>
          <br />
          j) Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority<br> <br />
          Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with
          a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your normal residence, you place of work or the
          place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you
          infringes the GDPR.<br> <br />
          The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged is required to inform the complainant on
          the progress and the outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to
          Article 78. <br> <br />
