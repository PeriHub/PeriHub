# Textview

The Textview will show two different files:

- Input file:
  - The input file which will be generated or uploaded. The file contains all necessary configurations needed for a peridynamic simulation. In the Textview the file can also be modified. 
- Log file:
  - For a running simulation the log file can be retrieved manually or automatically.
